Description: Contains a 'shiny' application called AdEPro (Animation of
    Adverse Event Profiles) which (audio-)visualizes adverse events
    occurring in clinical trials. As this data is usually considered
    sensitive, this tool is provided as a stand-alone application that can
    be launched from any local machine on which the data is stored.
